# Sum of prime-indexed elements

You will be given an integer array and your task is to return the sum of elements occupying prime-numbered indices.
The first element of the array is at index 0.

For example in the array: {1,2,3,4} the answer is 7 because indexes 2 and 3 contain numbers 3 and 4, 3 + 4 = 7.
